Probable Fiesta - AKA Checkout Kata

Assumptions made :
- A Scanner based input was not needed.
- That I did not need to test the Entity POJOs.
- The use of any framework was not allowed, opting for Core Java.

What would have been done with more time :
- Clear down basket properly & reset.
- Whilst an assumption was made not to need a scanner, allow for an input in the entrance method
- Potentially have made a UI (but would not have been Core Java at that point)
